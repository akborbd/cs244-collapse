OptAck Exploit Code from attack described in :
CCS2005 "Misbehaving TCP Receivers Can Cause Internet-Wide Congestion Collapse"
Rob Sherwood, Bobby Bhattacharjee, Ryan Braud


NOTES:

0) `gmake` to build
1) built on a Linux 2.6.x system with iptables.  Tried to be portable,
	but raw socket stuff is inherently non-portable: YMMV.
2) Need to firewall off traffic from the victim so that the exploit
	can muck with the TCP stream without interference from the kernel.
	Tried to use libdnet, but if there are problems, may need to
	firewall off victims by hand.
	e.g., foreach victim, `iptables -A INPUT -s victim  -m tcp -p tcp --sport 80 -j DROP`
3) The "victimsfile" is a required parameter, which is a whitespace separated file with
one victim per line of the form:

<URL to victim1>	<filesize>	[Hostname]
<URL to victim2>	<filesize>	[Hostname]
...

See the file 'victims.example', the optional [Hostname] tag is for HTTP
Virtual Hosting.

4) Currently only http is supported - this is a proof of concept after all.
5) Multiple HTTP Get's in a session doesn't quite work - POC code...
6) Current code is optimized for many, slow reliable optack connections,
	not one fast connection.  As a result, each connection averages about 250KB/s.
	For more traffic, add more victims.  This is not an inherent limitation in the attack.
